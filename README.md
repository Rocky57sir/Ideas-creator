We need a reliable Security Guard to handle interior and exterior security through manual observation and the use of on-site cameras. The Security Guard will be responsible for using corporate protocol to greet facility guests, assigning the proper security badge to each visitor, monitoring the interior and exterior of the facility, checking to make sure that certain doors are locked when they are supposed to be and reporting any suspicious activity to the local police department immediately. The ideal candidate for this position has a background in security and a professional disposition.
